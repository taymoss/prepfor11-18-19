    <h1>Prep for 11/18/19</h1>
       <p> There are 9 different types of D3 layouts the three most common types are: pie, stack, and force. The 9 types are listed below.</p>
    <ul>
   <ol>Chord</ol>
         <ol>Cluster</ol> 
         <ol>Force</ol> 
         <ol>Pack</ol> 
         <ol>Partition</ol> 
         <ol>Pie</ol> 
         <ol>Stack</ol>  
         <ol>Tree</ol> 
         <ol>Treemap</ol>
       </ul>
       <p>For each layout we have to start by saying which layout we want. For example, if you want a pie layout, then you use d3.pie. They all need the basics of the d3 algorithm, and they all need attributes that make them each unique. Then for each layout you add the respective elements that they need to make the visual. Each layout has different things that make them what they are.  </p>
